** THE PLAYGROUND IS NOT LIVE, THIS IS BEING WORKED ON**

# The Playground
This is a distributed learning community around decentralized systems. We're
funding 6-week long learning adventures to create knowledge and explore the
future of learning organizations.

## Motivation and Vision
Today's learning institutions are floundering. They divide ideas and people into
arbitrary silos, creating barriers against collaboration in the pursuit of
knowledge.

The tools and systems available today allow us to do better. We can build
structures that enable individuals to organize without intermediation, working
towards the goals that matter to them.

**This is a community to explore this future**

Our focus is on decentralized systems. They give us powerful tools and are
driving a revolution in digital infrastructure .

The playground challenges you to envision your ideal learning environment build
it, and connect it to others. By enabling these connections we're creating a
community empowering learning above all. 

----------

# How does it work?
The Playground funds adventures. Each learner on an adventure defines its
subject and structure, what they're learning and how. $5000 is distributed to
learners over a 6 week period in ETH and DAI, to enable experimentation and
creation. Each learner can use credentials created through the [fathom protocol](https://fathom.network)

Each adventure is documented in [/adventures](/adventures).

If you're looking for some inspiration for your proposal check out some
[ideas](https://github.com/jaredpereira/playground/labels/idea),
[other
proposals](https://github.com/jaredpereira/playground/labels/proposal)
or [funded adventures](/adventures)

## Step 1. Propose an Adventure
Anyone can propose an adventure by opening a [Pull
Request](https://github.com/jaredpereira/playground/new/master/adventures) to
add an adventure document.

Adventures can be anything around decentralized systems and learning. They could
consist of explorations of a niche subject, original research, study groups, or
any other scenario you can imagine. For a proposal you need to decide how best
to describe _your_ adventure.

There are some general elements that your proposal should cover that others will
judge, connect to, and build on:

### A Goal
Every adventure is a journey towards knowledge. What do you want to learn about
decentralized systems? What interests excites or inspires you? To coordinate
around your adventure the playground community needs to understand what it is
you're setting out to learn. These can be captured as concepts, or subjects or
credentials.

### Structures
_How_ are you going to learn? What are the systems and processes that will best
create knowledge for you? What are the resources they will connect to? These can
be rigid or open-ended, but should be clearly defined.

### Community
An adventure does not exist in isolation. It should build upon, connect
to, support, and involve other adventures and the broader community. Who are you
working with, who are the people who will support you? How will your learning
connect to others?

### Artifacts and Outcomes
Finally, adventures result in artifacts. Producing something concrete is a
powerful anchor for learning. It can be anything from software created to a log
of your experiences. These artifacts should be openly-licensed and accessible to
all.


## Step 2. Get your proposal reviewed
Once you create a proposal, it's public. Others can comment on it, fork it, or
suggest changes. You can mark your proposal as Work-In-Progress if you would
like for it to be public but not yet reviewed.

When you're ready your PR will be assigned a [reviewer](#reviewers) to evaluate your proposal.
They can ask questions or provide suggestions and
feedback, before making a decision.

### Criteria
Adventures are judged on:

- How well defined they are
- How they engage with existing adventures and the broader community
- Whether they create knowledge, or support the creation of knowledge

These criteria extend to all aspects of an adventure: subject,
structure, community, and artifacts.

### Decision Making
A reviewer can either close a proposal, if they think it's not valuable
to fund, or they can escalate it.

Once escalated all reviewers read the proposal. A proposal can then be
passed in one of two ways: 

1. Majority consensus from all reviewers
2. A single reviewer can unanimously pass a proposal with a wildcard (each
reviewer begins their term with 2)

Even if you're adventure proposal is rejected, you can iterate on it and apply
again at any time.

You can see the current reviewers [here](#reviewers).

## Step 3. Get Funds and Embark on Your Adventure

### Distribution via smart-contracts 
Once your adventure is accepted a smart-contract is instantiated in order
to distribute funds.

The smart contract will allow you to withdraw funds at a fixed rate. It will
also allow the [Dictator](#dictator) to freeze the funds indefinitely. This will
**only** be used if a participant stops actively working towards their
adventure.

### Learning and Adventuring
Once you're adventure actually begins, what it looks like is entirely how you
defined it. This is the most exciting part. You're a part of this community,
talking to other adventurers, creating the educational systems of the future.

## Step 4. Get Credentials

Credentials are a powerful tool within the Playground. We use the
[fathom-protocol](https://fathom.network) to collaboratively create and issue
credentials in any concept or subject that we need to.

You can use these credentials both within the playground, to shape and connect
your learning experience, and outside of it, to communicate that experience to
others.

### The Fathom Network

The Playground and the Fathom Network are tied together. You are the first users
of this protocol. Creating new concepts, and coming to consensus on what they
mean and how they can be assessed is integral to leveraging credentials in your
adventures.

# Change and Governance
The playground, this community and the systems that support it, is
intended to grow and change, and so needs a governance model.

## PLIPS
The main mechanism for change in the Playground are PLIPs, Playground
Improvement Proposals. Anyone can create one by opening an
[issue](https://github.com/jaredpereira/playground/issues/new?template=PLIP.md).

After discussion a PlIP should result in an PR which can only be merged in by
the [Dictator](#dictator). However, PLIPS can change any part of the Playground,
including this rule.

# Appendix

## Roles
### Reviewers

Reviewers select adventures and new reviewers. Anyone can become a reviewer by
opening a [nomination
issue](https://github.com/jaredpereira/playground/issues/new?template=reviewerNomination.md).
Each reviewer operates for a fixed term, and new reviewers are added via
majority consensus.

| Name          | Term Start | Wildcards |
|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Jared Pereira | 2018/04/06 | 2         |
|               |            |           |


### Dictator

The dictator controls funds and passes PLIPS. They operates for a fixed term and
select their successor. The dictator model is a short term solution the
playground to explore and iterate. It should be replaced by a more robust
governance system as soon as possible.

| Name          | Term Start | Term End   |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| Jared Pereira | 2018/04/05 | 2018/08/01 |


### Funds
| Funder | Date       | Amount |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Test   | 2018-04-06 | $1000  |
|        |            |        |
