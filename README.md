# The Playground
This is a distributed learning community creating new learning infrastructure.
We're embarking on 6-week long learning adventures to create knowledge and
explore the future of learning.

## Motivation and Vision
Today's learning institutions are floundering. They divide ideas and people into
arbitrary silos, creating barriers against collaboration in the pursuit of
knowledge.

The tools and systems available today allow us to do better. We can build
structures that enable individuals to organize without intermediation, working
towards the goals that matter to them.

**This is a community to explore this future**

The playground challenges you to envision your ideal learning environment build
it, and connect it to others. By enabling these connections we're creating a
community empowering learning above all, and spawing novel learning structures
that will scale and propagate throughout society.

# What's a Learning Adventure?

The Playground is composed of **learing adventures**. These are 6-week long journeys
exploring the future of learning. Each learner on an adventure defines its goal
and structure, what they're learning and how.

They can be:

- an exploration of a niche subject with a new research system
- original research into learning and public transport
- Running a study groups around a textbook with a protocol to federate with
other study groups
- or anything else you can imagine. 

Through their goal _or_ structure, they are exploring a future of learning.

Each adventure is documented in [/adventures](/adventures).

Anyone and everyone is welcome to embark on their own adventure. This community
is here to support you, hold you accountable, and 

If you're looking for some inspiration check out some
[ideas](https://github.com/jaredpereira/playground/labels/idea), and
[adventures](/adventures)

## Step 1. Propose an Adventure

Your adventures can be anything exploring learning! Hence, for a proposal you
need to decide how best to describe _your_ adventure.

Here are some things you might need to explain:

### A Goal
Every adventure is a journey towards knowledge. What do you want to learn about?
What interests excites or inspires you? To coordinate around your adventure the
playground community needs to understand what it is you're setting out to learn.
These are the concepts or ideas your adventure is exploring.

### Structures
_How_ are you going to learn? What are the systems and processes that will best
create knowledge for you? What are the resources they will connect to? These can
be rigid or open-ended, but should be clearly defined.

### Community
An adventure does not exist in isolation. It should build upon, connect
to, support, and involve other adventures and the broader community. Who are you
working with, who are the people who will support you? How will your learning
connect to others?

### Artifacts and Outcomes
Finally, adventures result in artifacts. Producing something concrete is a
powerful anchor for learning. It can be anything from software created to a log
of your experiences. These artifacts should be openly-licensed and accessible to
all.

**Once you've figured this all out you submit your adventure by opening a [Merge
Request](https://gitlab.com/fathom/fathom-playground/playground/merge_requests/new***
to add an adventure document.**

## Step 2. Get your proposal merged in
Once you create a proposal, it's public. Others can comment on it, fork it, or
suggest changes. You can mark your proposal as Work-In-Progress if you would
like for it to be public but not yet merged in.

### Criteria
We're not here to pass value judgements. It's up to you to decide what you think
it's important to explore. Instead the community validates:

- Is your adventure well defined and explicit?
- Is it realistic? Are you trying to do something impossible or unreasonable?
- Is it novel/have you connected it to others who are doing the same?
- Are you commited?

**Anyone who has completed an adventure in the last 2 months can verify your
proposal and merge it in.**

## Step 3. Embark on Your Adventure

Once you're adventure actually begins, what it looks like is entirely how you
defined it. This is the most exciting part. 

**You're a part of this community, talking to other adventurers, creating the
educational systems of the future.****

## Step 4. Get Credentials

Credentials are a powerful tool within the Playground. We use the
[fathom-protocol](https://fathom.network** to collaboratively create and issue
credentials in any concept or subject that we need to.

Other adventurers who have gone before you in similar fields act as assessors of
your experience, and when you're assessed you can for those who come after.
These are supportive, growing, credentials defined by community consensus, not
by central authority.

**You can use these credentials both within the playground, to shape and connect
your learning experience, and outside of it, to communicate that experience to
others.**

### The Fathom Network

The Playground and the Fathom Network are tied together. You are the first users
of this protocol. Creating new concepts, and coming to consensus on what they
mean and how they can be assessed is integral to leveraging credentials in your
adventures.

# Funded Adventures

Anyone can start an adventure of their own volition and using whatever resources
they have. 

To empower and support ambitious adventures we are aiming to offer a series of
grants to adventurers. Each of these will have their own application process and
criteria behind them to encourage a diversity of directions. While the
playground itself welcomes all adventures in any field or direction (as long as
it's structured for learning) grants can be constrained to specific domains or
types.

## Sponsoring Adventure Grants

We're looking for individuals and insitutions to sponsor adventures. If you're
in need of better learning systems in the world (aren't we all) or want to see
specific kinds of adventures run, please reach out, either by creating an issue
in this repository or sending an email to `contact(at)fathom.network`. 

## Current Grants
### Adventures-In-Residence:
This is a grants program offering $5000 for adventures pioneering the
playground. If you're interested, reach out with your adventure proposal to `contact(at)fathom.network`.

# Growing the Playground
Right now the playground is small. As we spawn and run adventures we want to
reflect, iterate, and transform the playground into a solid foundation.

This document is the source of truth for the playground community. Anyone can
propose changes to it by opening up a Merge Request. As such we hope that it
will develop to reflect the values and processes that drive our community.

## Questions
We have some questions we want to answer to inform this process. These are
meant to guide changes to the playground and the tools it uses.

### Playground Parameters and Structures
- Are the constraints around adventures optimal?
- Are the tools and systems we're using to collaborate working towards our goals?
- Is our review process effective and fair both for grants and regular adventures?
- Is the playground process reproducible/forkable/scalable?
- What kinds of adventures are succeeding/failing?

### Fathom
- What tools and systems are neccessary for interacting with the fathom protocol
- What are the most immediate and natural use-cases for decentralized
  credentials in a learning community
- Are individuals able to come to consensus on assessments
- Are the parameters of the Fathom Network appropriate:
  - Consensus Distance
  - Minimum size
  - Inflation rate
  - Challenge Periods
  
## Getting Data
All adventures and discussions in this repo are public and so are an excellent
source of data. However we also want to captures more in depth data in the form
of interviews with adventurers. These will be publicly compiled and shared in
their own repository (or might even be an adventure of their own).
